                <p><strong>Albert Einstein</strong> was a German mathematician and physicist who developed the special
                    and general theories of relativity. In 1921, he won the <em>Nobel Prize</em> in Physics for his
                    explanation of the photoelectric effect. In the following decade, he immigrated to the United States
                    after being targeted by the German Nazi Party. His work also had a major impact on the development
                    of atomic energy. In his later years, Einstein focused on unified field theory. He died in April
                    1955 at age 76. With his passion for inquiry, Einstein is generally considered the most influential
                    physicist of the 20th century. In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), 
                    Einstein published four groundbreaking papers. These outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, 
                    explained Brownian motion, introduced his special theory of relativity—a theory which addressed the inability 
                    of classical mechanics to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic field—and demonstrated 
                    that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In 1915, he proposed a general 
                    theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he 
                    published the following year laid out the implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution 
                    of the universe as a whole. The middle part of his career also saw him making important contributions to statistical 
                    mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of 
                    particles, subsequently called photons.</p>
